##Starting the Flask Development Server:
When you run the script, Flask will start a development server, and you should see output similar to this in your terminal:

Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

##Accessing the API Endpoints:
You can access the API endpoints by making HTTP requests to the URLs specified in your code. For example:

To sign up a user, you would make a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/signup.
To log in, you would make a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/login.
To upload a file, you would make a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload.
To list files, you would make a GET request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/list_files.
##API Responses:

The API endpoints will respond with JSON data, typically including messages and data relevant to the specific operation. For example, after signing up, you'll receive a JSON response confirming successful registration.
When you log in, you'll receive an access token, which you can use for authenticated requests to protected endpoints like /upload, /list_files, and /download.
##Uploading and Downloading Files:

When you upload a file using the /upload endpoint, the file will be saved in the uploads folder (as specified in your UPLOAD_FOLDER configuration).
To download a file, you can use the /download/<filename> endpoint, where <filename> is the name of the file you want to download. If the user has permission, the file will be served for download.
##Error Handling:

The code includes basic error handling for cases such as incorrect file formats, file not found, or permission denied when trying to download files.
##JWT Authentication:

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for user authentication. When you log in, you receive an access token, which should be included in the headers of subsequent authenticated requests.
##MongoDB Integration:

User data (username and password) and file metadata (filename and user_id) are stored in MongoDB. Be sure to have MongoDB running and configured properly with the URI 'mongodb://localhost:27017/file_sharing'.
##Debug Mode:

The application is running in debug mode (debug=True), which means it will provide detailed error messages in case of issues. In a production environment, you should set debug=False and configure proper error handling
